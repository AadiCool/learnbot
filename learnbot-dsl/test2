# Sample code for translation, Author: @Aniq55 (Aniq Ur Rahman) Date: 04/06/2017
# The DSL is a simpler imitation of python. The code here is translated to its python3 equivalent
# The comments begin with a hash but unlike python, indentation is not mandatory here
# the code blocks are marked through the use of end keyword

# The code within ``` is skipped by the translator

# Print statement

print "The script is running"

# Variable declaration

# Conditional statements

if alpha>beta then
	print "Alpha wins"
else if alpha == beta then
	print "Draw"
else if beta>alpha then
print "Beta wins"

print "Else is working"

# Mathematical operations
